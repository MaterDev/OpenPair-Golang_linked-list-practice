# OpenPair Golang - Linked List Practice

![Cover](./cover.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a series of exercises to help understand and implement linked lists in Go (Golang). There are three main exercises, each focusing on different aspects and complexities of linked lists, including singly linked lists, advanced operations, and doubly linked lists.

> This is the repository for **episode #7** of my Golang Streaming series on YouTube. Episodes can be watched here: [OpenPair: Golang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NvA4OAtDRS2wBL2FvjiSlKCtcBrcFzc)

## Repository Structure

- `basic_linked_list.go`: Implements a basic singly linked list with functionalities to add nodes at the end and display the list.
- `advanced_linked_list.go`: Expands upon the basic linked list, introducing methods to add nodes at the start, delete nodes, and reverse the list.
- `doubly_linked_list.go`: Implements a doubly linked list with the ability to add nodes at both ends, and display the list in both forward and reverse order.

## Getting Started

To run these exercises, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. 

1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Run each file using the Go command:

   ```bash
   go run ./src/basic_linked_list.go 
   go run ./src/advanced_linked_list.go
   go run ./src/doubly_linked_list.go
   ```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Linked List

Focuses on creating a simple singly linked list with basic operations like adding to the end and displaying the list.

### Exercise 2: Advanced Linked List Operations

Builds upon the basic linked list, adding functionality for adding to the start, deleting specific nodes, and reversing the list.

### Exercise 3: Doubly Linked List

Introduces the concept of a doubly linked list, where each node points to both its previous and next node. Includes methods for adding nodes, and displaying the list in both forward and reverse order.
